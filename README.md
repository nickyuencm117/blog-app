# Tech Stack
- [Vite](https://v3.vitejs.dev/) - Build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects
- [React](https://react.dev/) - Library for web and native user interfaces
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/home) - A router library for routing in React projects
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - CSS files where all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default

# Authentication
This app uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Upon successful login, a JWT is issued and sent to the client as a **cookie** named `accessToken`. This cookie is:

- **HTTP-only**: Not accessible via JavaScript, helping to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Secure**: Only sent over HTTPS connections.
- **SameSite=None**: Allows cross-site requests from your front-end applications.

To access protected endpoints, clients must include the `accessToken` cookie in their requests. The server will automatically verify the JWT from the cookie for authentication and authorization.

**Note:** 
- Make sure your client applications are served over HTTPS to ensure cookies are transmitted
- Make sure the cookie domain matches the client’s domain
